# Tiny-snake-board
This repository contains the source code I've written to make a tiny gaming board based on Attiny85 microcontroller.
<br >All the code has been written from scratch, using my own drivers, for didactic purpose. <br > 
I've also chosen to use the AVR assembly language to have a full control of the microcontroller and to learn as much as possible. <br > 
I had strict constraints due to the low amount of SRAM available in the Attiny85 (512 Bytes). <br > 
I really loved this project and I'm planning to do something similar with a more powerful mcu.
